<p>Close your eyes, exhale and relax, and watch as the tension begins to melt away the stresses of your day. Relaxation takes place in your body and slowly you surrender to a warm fragrant wave of water gently sweeping across your body. Peacefully lay back and enjoy the serenity of what you have created; your very own bathing ritual.  Bathing is an inherently pleasurable experience and creating an at-home bathing ritual is even more beneficial as it allows you to dedicate time to your wellâ€”being. Bathing is about much more than cleanliness, it can become your sanctuary; a place where pampering yourself transforms you to another place of peaceful serenity.</p>

<h3>The Atmosphere of the Bathroom</h3>

<p><span style="color:#0099cc; font-size:30px">H</span>owever small or large your bathroom is you can enjoy a relaxing bath, the most ordinary bathrooms can become a day spa retreat.  Start your ritual by first removing all the clutter from your bathroom. It is now a sanctuary, a place where self love and pampering take place.  After you have removed items that distract your mind, start with a nice warm water temperature in the bathtub as well as a comfortable air temperature. Make it to your comfort.  Gather big comfortable fluffy towels, they are essential to an indulgent bath. An oversize bathrobe of terry cloth or Egyptian cotton will work well.  Add essential oils, a blend of fragrances such as rose, ylang ylang, jasmine or a single scent of vanilla.  Choose a calming blend of body oil such as grapeseed oil, jojoba, or carrot oil and apply before getting in the bath.  This is a very relaxing sensation and will cocoon your skin as you soak in the warm water and help to lock in moisture as you soak.  If bubbles are a must, use one-hundred percent grated soap, natural soap flakes, or natural moisturizing milk bath. And of course a rich fragrant bar of Bathe and Company natural soap,</p>

<p>Lighting will put the finishing touch on the ambience of the bathroom leaving you nestled in a golden glow of beauty.  You can also add a heavenly dimension to the atmosphere by playing your favorite piece of music while sipping tea, eating fruit or rich dark chocolate. Apply a light body lotion or whipped body butter and sit for a moment, close your eyes, and take that peaceful moment with you as you exit your personal bathing retreat.</p></div>
